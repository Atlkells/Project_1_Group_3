# Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed fraudulent credit card transaction data to measure the level of impact across various parameters. The goal was to identify patterns that can support preventative action planning. 

# Description of the Data

We merged two simulated csv datasets of fraudulent credit card transactions. The merged dataset had close to 500,000 entries so we pulled a random sample of 10,000 transactions to analyze. We cleaned the data and removed unneccesary columns. We converted the base dataframe of the cleaned sample data to a csv which was utilized in each team members' code to ensure we were all using the same sample. 

The columns we performed our analysis on are:

  Trans_date_trans_time: Displays the date and time of the transaction
  Category: The transaction category (gas and transport, home, entertainment, etc.)
  Amt: The total amount (in USD) of the transaction
  Gender: The gender (M/F) of the victim
  City: The city where the transaction occurred
  State: The state where the transaction occurred
  Lat: The latitude where the transaction occurred
  Long: The longitude where the transaction occurred
  City_pop: The population of the city where the transaction occurred
  Dob: The date of birth of the victim
  Merch_lat: The latitude where the fraudulent merchant is located
  Merch_long: the longitude where the fraudulent merchant is located

# Research Questions

•	How does geography affect fraudulent transactions?
•	How does victim demographic impact the frequency of fraudulent transactions?
•	How is the frequency of fraudulent transactions impacted by merchant category?
•	How does timing impact frequency of fraudulent transactions?

# Communication Protocols

In order to update each other on the status of our individual parts of the project we established frequent communication through Slack and Zoom meetings.


# Data Tools Used

We used jupyter notebook, pandas, and python libraries to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
